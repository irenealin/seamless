# Seamless

**Seamless** is a discovery and recommendation platform for private dining and event-friendly restaurants.  
It helps users explore venues through an interactive map, curated recommendations, and **room-level details**, making it easier to plan group dining experiences without fragmented research.

This project was developed as part of **LLP ’26** (https://leanlaunchpad.stanford.edu/)
